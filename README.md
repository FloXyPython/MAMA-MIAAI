#MAMA-MIAAI - Here we go again
This is a derived dataset based on the publicly available MAMA-MIA dataset, which includes Breast MRI scans of 1506 subjects.

The original dataset does <b>not</b> include:
- Whole breast segmentation masks
- Bias field corrected scans

In this extended version, we provide:
- Whole breast segmentation masks for all subjects
- N4 bias field corrected MRI scans

The model is available at my [GitHub](https://github.com/FloXyPython/MRI_BreastSeg)
